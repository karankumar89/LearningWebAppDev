1. Our team project is build a web application that allows users to post ephemeral questions and other users can respond with an answer. The Question lasts for a period of 10 minutes. The user who asked the question can respond to the answers too. The question will no longer be available after it expires.

2. The list of API's that i have researched and shortlisted are
	a. Twitter API 
	b. Google Search API
	c. Facebook API
 
3. Twitter API - using the twitter search functions and hashtags, the user can see recent or relevent tweets from the keywords (taken from the question).
   Google Search API - using the Search function of Google, certian keywords from the question will be searched and given hints to the user.
   Facebook API - Using the Facebook authentication, a user can securly sign in and user details like - first name, last name and email can retrieved to create a profile instantly

4. The reason for choosing Google Search API is to provide more support than just answers. Sometimes there might be a situation where a user answer is'nt right, hence using custom search - a prompted search suggestions can be used to give users more than hejust answers

5. Google keeps making a lot of changes to API. Every time a change is made, we have to make the necessary changes to our application. This becomes a tedious task when the application becomes big and there is a major change in the API. Due to this kind of dependency, it becomes an issue sometimes to use Google Search API.

6. Since the Search feature is only an user-experience enhancement, we need to look for other API's that can help user getting efficient answers and suggestions to the question.

7. The Google API is very powerfull and easy to use. The Search can be used as a custom search where users can find answers and questions easily. More features like Geo-location services, Maps, etc can be inocorporated to the application.
